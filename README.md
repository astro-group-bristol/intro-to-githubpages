## How does Github Create a website?

Github runs a workflow that takes the files in your repository and creates a website from them. This is done using a tool called Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub Pages sites.





## TASK


Now lets try to create a website using one of the two methods.
If you are using the "Simple" route you can use the following template instructions. And move on to customising the template. With the Markdown files.

If you are using the "Hard" Just start with a blank index.html file. Your repoo will be at username.github.io.

Use this basic code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```



## Whats next?

- custom URLs? (You must own the domain)
- Customising the template.
